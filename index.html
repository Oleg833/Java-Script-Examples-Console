          <p class="my-name">
            My name is Daniel Smith. I'm a full stack developer. Coming to my skills I know CSS,
            HTML, JS. Also, I've mastered React and Node.js. I've been coding for ten months and
            during this time I've done three successful team projects and two individual ones. Due
            to this I'm good at core technical skills, organizational ethics and discipline. My goal
            is to get a job in a reputed company like yours where I can use my skills and knowledge
            to deliver good results in the long term. I'm eager to achieve a good position in the
            company to scale up the organization’s production and growth rate and at the same time
            for my personal career growth as well.
          </p>
          <p class="i-want">
            I want to be a front-end developer because I've worked hard to develop skills that are
            relevant to this industry and because this type of work brings me personal satisfaction.
            I feel especially good when I see that the website I created works perfectly. That’s the
            best reward for me! I've gained a lot of practical experience and become intimately
            familiar with several coding languages. Also, I participated in coding challenges and
            worked on personal coding projects. I'm excited to begin a career as a front-end
            developer and learn more about this line of work from industry professionals.
          </p>
          <p class="my-job">
            My last job was out of demand and I could not develop and grow as a professional. In
            addition to this, I value freedom and would like to work remotely and have flexible
            hours. Job as a software developer fully meets my requirements. I’m excited to learn
            something new, and I know this role will allow me to use my experience while also
            gaining new knowledge.
          </p>
          <p class="your-bisiness">
            Your business is a leader in the developer tools space, moreover when I was looking
            online, I noticed that the reviews of your company from current and former employees are
            great. I especially like how supporting new ideas is part of the corporate culture. I
            often have random ideas on how to improve my work, and I’d love to work for a business
            that is so supportive of anyone with an idea, irrespective of their experience.
          </p>
          <p class="salary">
            I know the average salary for this type of entry-level position is in the $600-$900
            dollars range. I think that I would be a great fit for the role due to my skills and
            knowledge, so I am expecting a salary within that range.
          </p>
          <p class="important">
            The most important to me is learning new things. Learning something new is to me a life
            force. Knowing that every day I will be a little uncomfortable, helps me stay alert and
            keep moving. The best jobs demand more of me than what I think I can do and challenge my
            thinking. I definitely don’t want to be working in a job I can do without effort or
            thought.
          </p>
          <p class="as-i-pursue">
            As I pursue a career advancement, I am looking forward to learning new skills and
            improving my knowledge. This year I am going to master front-end development. That’s why
            I have to get practical experience in React and Vue.js. And then, I am planning to
            advance my career as a fullstack developer. In a year, I want to start working with
            Node.js.
